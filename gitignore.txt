Hi Eleanor,



My name is Alex and I am a fourth-year student in Canada graduating very very soon and on the lookout for developer positions all over the world. As much as I love AI the AI-generated letter that Linkedin drafted up for me, I wanted to write one by hand because it feels more genuine. I hope this is a better read...



I have worked extensively with Python both in school and applicatively in work. Though I am not the most familiar with the ETL workflow, I would love to learn more and do my own research.



Aside from being a good fit, I love stability more than anything even though my resume might tell a different story. Now that I am graduating, I want nothing more than to find a place where I can progress in my field and settle down. That 98% retention rate sounds like absolute heaven.



I applied through Easy Apply on LinkedIn, and I totally understand if I am not the most qualified for the role. But if there are any similar roles along the lines of development and data work, I would very much appreciate it if you could consider me for those as well.



Excuse me for this long message, and thank you for taking the time to read it all. I look forward to hearing back from you!



Cheers,

Alex
